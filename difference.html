    <td>C is the oldest and most
used of the three. It was
invented by "Dennis
Ritchie" in 1972 and then
published in 1978, to
develop a new version of
Unix; The Unix operating
system used assembly
language, the lowest level
of programming that could
be read by a computer.</td>
    <td>C ++ is a medium-level
programming language, as it
relies on a low-level C
language but has more
advanced capabilities. Since
it was first published in
1985, it has become a very
versatile programming
language, which is used
alongside C in developing
operating systems. </td>
    <td>C # is technically more
complex than the three
languages, its syntax is less
error prone than C or C ++
and can be learned relatively
quickly. C # combines the
functions of C and C ++ with
Visual Basic, and is used on
many operating systems, not
just Windows. While C ++
supports object-oriented
programming and procedural
programming, C # is an
object-oriented programming
language only</td>
